    Most online services ask their users to trust them that they're being honest, and they usually
    are. However, traditional social media platforms have the ability to <strong
      >create forged content</strong> that can appear to be genuinely authored, but which are actually
    counterfeit.
  </p>
  <p>
    On <Link external href="https://nostr.com/">Nostr</Link>, all your content is authenticated
    using <strong>digital signatures</strong>, which cryptographically tie a particular person to a
    given post or message.
  </p>
  <p>
    The result is that you don't normally have to trust service providers not to tamper with the
    information flowing through the network â€” instead, your client software can prove that a given
    piece of data is authentic.
